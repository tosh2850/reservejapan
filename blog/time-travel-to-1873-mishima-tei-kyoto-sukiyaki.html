        <h2>A Hidden Portal to Japan's Meiji Era</h2>
        <p>You're walking through Kyoto's bustling Teramachi Shopping Arcade, weaving between tourists browsing anime merchandise and sneaker displays. Suddenly, through an unassuming doorway, you glimpse polished wood, red velvet, and the soft glow of antique gas lamps.</p>

        <div class="photo-block">
          <div class="label">[PHOTO PLACEMENT 1]</div>
          <p class="hint">Exterior shot of Mishima-tei entrance on Teramachi</p>
        </div>

        <p>This is Mishima-tei (三嶋亭), and stepping through its entrance is like passing through a portal to 1873.</p>
        <p>Founded in the sixth year of the Meiji Era, Mishima-tei isn't just one of Kyoto's best sukiyaki restaurants—it's a living piece of Japanese culinary history. Here, the art of Kansai-style sukiyaki has been perfected and preserved for over 150 years, served in private tatami rooms that have hosted generations of families, dignitaries, and discerning food lovers.</p>
        <p>But experiencing this slice of history requires more than just showing up. In this guide, we'll explore what makes Mishima-tei extraordinary and how you can secure your own private room for an unforgettable meal.</p>

        <hr style="border:none; border-top:1px solid #e2e8f0; margin: 2rem 0;" />

        <h2>The Atmosphere: Stepping Into Another Century</h2>
        <p>The transformation begins the moment you remove your shoes at the entrance. Your feet touch wood floors that have been polished by 140 years of careful stewardship. The modern world—with its neon signs and digital noise—simply evaporates.</p>

        <div class="photo-block">
          <div class="label">[PHOTO PLACEMENT 2]</div>
          <p class="hint">Interior corridor or private tatami room showing traditional architecture</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What You'll See:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Original architectural details from the Meiji period, lovingly maintained</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Antique gas lamps casting a warm, intimate glow</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Rich red carpeting that leads to your private sanctuary</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Traditional scroll paintings and seasonal flower arrangements</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Views of the interior Japanese garden from select rooms</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unlike the crowded, bustling atmosphere of modern restaurants, Mishima-tei offers something increasingly rare: privacy and tranquility. Your group has its own tatami room—a quiet space where conversation flows naturally, where you can take your time, and where the focus remains entirely on the food and your companions.</p>
        <p>This is the setting for special occasions: anniversary dinners, family celebrations, or simply a meal you'll remember for years to come.</p>

        <hr style="border:none; border-top:1px solid #e2e8f0; margin: 2rem 0;" />

        <h2>The Experience: Kansai-Style Sukiyaki Performed at Your Table</h2>
        <p>If you've eaten sukiyaki in Tokyo, prepare yourself for something different. Mishima-tei follows the traditional Kansai (Western Japan) approach, and the difference is dramatic.</p>

        <div class="photo-block">
          <div class="label">[PHOTO PLACEMENT 3]</div>
          <p class="hint">Action shot of sukiyaki being prepared tableside</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Kansai Method: A Culinary Performance</h3>
        <p>In Tokyo-style sukiyaki, ingredients simmer in a pre-mixed sauce called warishita. The Kansai method is more theatrical—and more flavorful.</p>
        <p>Your kimono-clad attendant (nakai-san) becomes your personal chef, preparing everything at your table in a carefully choreographed sequence:</p>

        <ol style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0.5rem 1.25rem; color:#334155;">
          <li><strong>The sugar</strong>: Granulated sugar is sprinkled directly onto the hot cast-iron pan, where it begins to melt and caramelize</li>
          <li><strong>The beef</strong>: Paper-thin slices of premium Wagyu are laid onto the sugar, immediately beginning to sizzle</li>
          <li><strong>The seasoning</strong>: As the meat browns, soy sauce and sake are added, creating a rich, caramelized glaze</li>
          <li><strong>The finish</strong>: Vegetables are added, each at the perfect moment to preserve texture and flavor</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The aroma is intoxicating. The sound of sizzling beef fills your private room. And the taste—intense, rich, perfectly balanced between sweet and savory—is unlike anything else.</p>

        <h3>The Ritual of Raw Egg</h3>
        <p>Each slice of beef is meant to be dipped in a small bowl of raw egg before eating. This traditional method might sound unusual to Western diners, but it serves multiple purposes: it cools the piping-hot meat to the perfect temperature, adds a silky richness, and creates a complete flavor experience that defines authentic sukiyaki.</p>
        <p>The quality of Mishima-tei's Wagyu—beautifully marbled, melt-in-your-mouth tender—shines through this simple preparation. Many guests describe it as the best beef they've ever tasted.</p>

        <hr style="border:none; border-top:1px solid #e2e8f0; margin: 2rem 0;" />

        <h2>The Challenge: Securing Your Reservation</h2>
        <p>Mishima-tei's combination of historical significance, exceptional quality, and convenient location makes it one of Kyoto's most sought-after dining experiences. This popularity creates real challenges for international travelers.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the Dynamics</h3>

        <div class="ideal-box">
          <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Lunch vs. Dinner:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Lunch courses (¥8,000-12,000) offer excellent value, but the lower price point means fierce competition for tables</span></li>
            <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>Dinner courses (¥16,000-20,000) provide a more leisurely pace and better availability, though advance booking is still essential</span></li>
            <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span>The most exclusive private rooms can book out weeks ahead, especially during peak seasons (cherry blossom and autumn foliage)</span></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Private Room Factor:</h3>
          <p>The authentic Mishima-tei experience happens in a private tatami room, but these are limited. The restaurant prioritizes groups and special occasions for these spaces, and communicating the nature of your celebration—anniversary, family reunion, proposal—can improve your chances.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Phone Reservations Matter</h3>
        <p>While Mishima-tei has some online booking options, phone reservations remain crucial for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span><strong>Flexibility</strong>: When the online system shows "fully booked," staff can sometimes find alternatives or add you to a waitlist</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span><strong>Customization</strong>: Communicating dietary restrictions, room preferences, or course modifications requires real conversation</span></li>
          <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span><span><strong>Timing</strong>: Last-minute changes or earlier time slots often become available but aren't reflected online immediately</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Language Reality:</h3>
        <p>Mishima-tei's staff are professionals focused on delivering exceptional service to their guests. While they're accustomed to international visitors in person, phone reservations in English can be challenging. The staff are busy preparing and serving meals, and complex discussions about dietary needs or room preferences require language fluency that may not always be available.</p>

        <hr style="border:none; border-top:1px solid #e2e8f0; margin: 2rem 0;" />
